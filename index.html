            <h3>The Middle of Middle Earth</h3>
            <p>
              Wellington has the reputation of coolest little capital in the
              world. It is well known for it's coffee, museums and arts scene.
              People come from around the world to visit the Weta Workshop, home
              of the Lord of the Rings. Various filming locations can be visited
              in the region. Te Papa Tongarewa is the national museum with ever
              changing world class exhibits. The Wellington Zoo has just
              welcomed new Snow Leopards. Whether you want time in nature, spend
              time in a foodie paradise, or view works from some of the world's
              masters, you can't go past Wellington.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the capital city, there are many ways to get to Wellington. It
              has it's own international airport with flights arriving every
              day. Visitors may also like to fly into the other major airports
              in New Zealand, Auckland in the North Island and Christchurch in
              the South Island. You can then travel to Wellington by scenic or
              passenger train, bus, car, or a ferry between the North and South
              Islands.
